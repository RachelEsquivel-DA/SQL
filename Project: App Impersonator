/*Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

/* What does the app's SQL look like? */

CREATE TABLE fetch (receipt_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, date TEXT, store TEXT, receipt_total NUMERIC, fetch_points NUMERIC);

INSERT INTO fetch (date, store, receipt_total, fetch_points) VALUES ("2023-12-1", "Amazon", 23.91, 25);
INSERT INTO fetch (date, store, receipt_total, fetch_points) VALUES ("2023-12-1", "Jewel", 210.02, 100);
INSERT INTO fetch (date, store, receipt_total, fetch_points) VALUES ("2023-12-2", "TJ Maxx", 54.89, 25);
INSERT INTO fetch (date, store, receipt_total, fetch_points) VALUES ("2023-12-5", "Amazon", 30.94, 25);

SELECT * FROM fetch;

--Update a detail in the data and show the change.
UPDATE fetch SET date = "2023-12-3" WHERE receipt_id = 4;

SELECT * FROM fetch;

--Alter the table by adding a column and show the change and default answer for missing data. 
ALTER TABLE fetch ADD fetch_bonus NUMERIC DEFAULT "0";

--Add new data for the table and include data for the new column added in the previous step.
INSERT INTO fetch (date, store, receipt_total, fetch_points, fetch_bonus) VALUES ("2023-12-4", "Walmart", 132.49, 25, 150);

SELECT * FROM fetch;

--Delete one row of data without altering any other rows and show the change.
DELETE FROM fetch WHERE receipt_id = 3;   

SELECT * FROM fetch;
